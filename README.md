# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Tim!

I'm a **mostly** self-taught programmer (did double IT for A level but decided to go down a different road) and sharing a few of the things I am making on here!

I mostly play around with Flutter/Dart, Python and a bit of C++ (for microcontrollers). I taught myself Java a few years ago too. Have dabbled in HTML/CSS/JavaScript too.
